# NewsApp
- It is a news app ,you can see many news according to your interested category.
- This app also has a Dark Mode feature and also a loading bar which gives user a loading satisfaction.
- I have tried to deploy this app but its API Key will not work due to different domain and it charges for different domain.
- So i would urge whoever is cloning this app plz make your own news API Key and put it in App.jsx component in Route attribute. 

# Here are some glimps of this app
